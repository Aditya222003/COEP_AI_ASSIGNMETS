DATA VISUALIZATION (we need LIBRARY and DATA SET)
PROBLEM STATEMENT + DATA SET

STANDARD DATA SET NEEDED

DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
EX -SOLVING A PROBLEM RELATED TO ENBEDDED SYSTEMS - PROBLEM STATEMENT GIVEN (DETAILS OF THE DATA SET)
TYPES OF CHART - HISTOGRAM(PLOT OF PIXEL VALUES VS COUNT)


[1] DATA CHARACTERISTICS - MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS AND OPERATIONS


AI SYSTEM-
CONTROL STRATEGY
RULE APPLYER (1 CONDITION AND MULTIPLE RULES)

SPECTRAL SIGNATURE (EX- TWO DIFFERENT SATELLITE IMAGES DEPICITING WATER BODIES IN EUROPE AND INDIA, THEY ARE DIFFERENT)
CAN DEFINE A RANGE (X - Y) AND THEN DECLARING IT TO BE A TYPE OF OBJECT
REFLECTANCE VALUE - STORED IN STANDARD SPECTRAL DIGITAL LIBRARY

STUDY ALMOST 15-20 NUMBER OF PLOTS
[EX CHLOROPLETH MAP, WORD CLOUD, ]


***FOR PROJECT SHOW THE SYNOPSIS USE THE TIMELINE TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS
